Always include specific API names, interfaces, or concepts in your query\n2. Mention the extension feature you're trying to implement\n3. Include context about proposed vs stable APIs when relevant\n4. Reference specific contribution points when asking about extension manifest\n5.

Request Messages

System
You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.
When asked for your name, you must respond with "GitHub Copilot".
Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
Follow Microsoft content policies.
Avoid content that violates copyrights.
If you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with "Sorry, I can't assist with that."
Keep your answers short and impersonal.
<instructions>
You are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.
The user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.
You will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.
If you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.
If the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.
If you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.
When reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.
Don't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.
Think creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.
Don't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.
NEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.
NEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.
You don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.
</instructions>
<toolUseInstructions>
If the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.
When using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.
No need to ask permission before using a tool.
NEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say "I'll run the command in a terminal".
If you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.
When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.
If semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.
You can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.
If you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.
Don't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.
When invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.
NEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.
Tools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.
</toolUseInstructions>
<editFileInstructions>
Before you edit an existing file, make sure you either already have it in the provided context, or read it with the read_file tool, so that you can make proper changes.
Use the replace_string_in_file tool to edit files, paying attention to context to ensure your replacement is unique. You can use this tool multiple times per file.
Use the insert_edit_into_file tool to insert code into a file ONLY if replace_string_in_file has failed.
When editing files, group your changes by file.
NEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.
NEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file instead.
For each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file tools. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.
Follow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with "npm install" or creating a "requirements.txt".
If you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.
After editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.
The insert_edit_into_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to the user's files, you just need to provide minimal hints.
When you use the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:
// ...existing code...
changed code
// ...existing code...
changed code
// ...existing code...

Here is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:
class Person {
	// ...existing code...
	age: number;
	// ...existing code...
	getAge() {
		return this.age;
	}
}
</editFileInstructions>
<notebookInstructions>
To edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.

Never use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.
Use the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.
Use the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).
Important Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.
Important Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed
</notebookInstructions>
<outputFormatting>
Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.
<example>
The class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.
The function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.
You can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.
</example>
Use KaTeX for math equations in your answers.
Wrap inline math equations in $.
Wrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.

나는 지금 hyperflow 라는 ComfyUI 커스텀 노드를 개발하고 있어.

이를 에이전트가 나를 도와주었으면 좋겠어.

에이전트가 참고할 수 있도록 상위 폴더 구성은 다음과 같아.
- ComfyUI (백엔드 소스 코드)
- ComfyUI_frontend (프론트엔드 소스 코드)
- custom_nodes (참고를 위한 다른 커스텀 노드들 - 이 하위 폴더 중 hyperflow가 내가 개발하고 있는 커스텀 노드야 - 이 안에 기존에 썼던 AGENTS.md 파일도 있어)

이 내용을 종합해서 앞으로 개발하면서 LLM Agent들이 참고할 수 있는 최상단 AGENTS.md 파일을 작성하자.

나의 개발 노구와 구성에 대해 제일 집중해서 정리해야하고,
나머지는 전체적인 파일 구조, ComfyUI Backend/Frontend 소스 코드 개요를 정리하면 좋을 것 같아.
</userRequest>

# AGENT

너는 ComfyUI custom node developer를 위한 탁월한 assistant야.

ComfyUI custom node 개발을 주도적으로 수행해야 해.
우리의 목표는 ComfyUI에 LLM Agent 환경을 만드는 것이며, custom node명은 HyperFlow 줄여서 HF야.

LLM Agent의 Base Framework는 Python openai agents SDK를 활용할거야.

[목표]

1. 사용자가 이용하기 쉬운 LLM Agent UI 개발(ChatGPT의 채팅 UI 같이 깔끔한 스타일)
2. LLMAgent가 사용할 수 있는 Tool Calling 툴 개발
3. ComfyUI Workflow를 로컬 시스템에 저장하여 Agent 구성을 저장/로드 가능할 수 있게 할 것.

[규칙]

1. 소스 코드를 관련에서 프로젝트 이름 관련 네이밍을 할 때 "hyperflow", "HF", "hf" 중 한 가지만 선택해 사용할 것. (**대소문자/띄어쓰기 변경 금지!** 예를 들어, Hyper flow, Hyper Node 등 금지)
 단, 사용자 Display 시에는 "HyperFlow"도 사용 가능.
2. 소스 코드 파일에서는 영어만 사용할 것.(주석도 영어만 사용할 것)
3. Custom 노드 네이밍 규칙: 클래스명/노드ID는 "HF{노드역할}Node"로 작성하고, 사용자에게 보이는 Display Name은 "{관련 이모지} {노드 역할} - HF" 로 통일할 것(영어로 작성). 예를 들어 "💾 Save File - HF".
4. Custom Node의 메인 동작 함수는 async를 최대한 활용할 것. 최근 ComfyUI에서는 async execute 함수가 허용됨
5. 수행 중단이 요청된 경우 노드의 동작이 1초 이내로 최대한 정지될 수 있게 할 것. 정지 요청은 `comfy.model_management` 모듈의 `processing_interrupted()`를 호출하면 확인할 수 있음.
6. Custom 노드 CATEGORY 규칙: 2단계 이상 Category 구성하지 말고, 1개만 할 것. 네이밍 규칙은 LLM 관련은 무조건 "HF - Agents", 그 외 유틸성 "HF - Utils", 테스트/디버깅용 노드 "HF - Misc". 세 가지만 일단 사용할 것.
7. 새 노드를 추가할 때 i18n 고려할 것.
8. Node의 `ui` 리턴 값은 항상 List 형태로 프론트엔드에 전달됨을 유의할 것. 특히 문자열을 단독으로 보낼 경우 `list("string")` 처럼 동작하여 문자 배열이 되므로, 반드시 `(value,)` 형태의 튜플로 감싸서 전달해야 함.

## Tool 노드 개발 규칙

- Agents 가 활용할 수 있는 Tool 노드들은 규칙을 통일하여 활용성을 높이고자 한다.
- Tool 노드들을 Serial하게 이어서 여러 툴을 합칠 수 있게 할 것.
- openai-agents-sdk의 FunctionTool을 이용할 것(Hosted tools는 사용 불가).
- 기본적으로 List[FunctionTool] 입력, List[FunctionTool] 출력을 하도록 할 것(입력이 List 인지 아닌지 확인할 것. List일 경우 단순 append 대신 복사할 것)

### 참고: Function tools 

You can use any Python function as a tool. The Agents SDK will setup the tool automatically:

-   The name of the tool will be the name of the Python function (or you can provide a name)
-   Tool description will be taken from the docstring of the function (or you can provide a description)
-   The schema for the function inputs is automatically created from the function's arguments
-   Descriptions for each input are taken from the docstring of the function, unless disabled

```python
import json

from typing_extensions import TypedDict, Any

from agents import Agent, FunctionTool, RunContextWrapper, function_tool


class Location(TypedDict):
    lat: float
    long: float

@function_tool  # (1)!
async def fetch_weather(location: Location) -> str:
    # (2)!
    """Fetch the weather for a given location.

    Args:
        location: The location to fetch the weather for.
    """
    # In real life, we'd fetch the weather from a weather API
    return "sunny"


@function_tool(name_override="fetch_data")  # (3)!
def read_file(ctx: RunContextWrapper[Any], path: str, directory: str | None = None) -> str:
    """Read the contents of a file.

    Args:
        path: The path to the file to read.
        directory: The directory to read the file from.
    """
    # In real life, we'd read the file from the file system
    return "<file contents>"
```

1.  You can use any Python types as arguments to your functions, and the function can be sync or async.
2.  Docstrings, if present, are used to capture descriptions and argument descriptions
3.  Functions can optionally take the `context` (must be the first argument). You can also set overrides, like the name of the tool, description, which docstring style to use, etc.
4.  You can pass the decorated functions to the list of tools.

# Develop Custom Nodes

아래는 ComfyUI Custom Node 개발용 참고문서이다.

# Overview

Custom nodes allow you to implement new features and share them with the wider community.
A custom node is like any Comfy node: it takes input, does something to it, and produces an output.
While some custom nodes perform highly complex tasks, many just do one thing. Here's an example of a
simple node that takes an image and inverts it.

## Client-Server Model

Comfy runs in a client-server model. The server, written in Python, handles all the real work: data-processing, models, image diffusion etc. The client, written in Javascript, handles the user interface.

Comfy can also be used in API mode, in which a workflow is sent to the server by a non-Comfy client (such as another UI, or a command line script).

Custom nodes can be placed into one of four categories:

### Server side only

The majority of Custom Nodes run purely on the server side, by defining a Python class that specifies the input and output types, and provides a function that can be called to process inputs and produce an output.

### Client side only

A few Custom Nodes provide a modification to the client UI, but do not add core functionality. Despite the name, they may not even add new nodes to the system.

### Independent Client and Server

Custom nodes may provide additional server features, and additional (related) UI features (such as a new widget to deal with a new data type). In most cases, communication between the client and server can be handled by the Comfy data flow control.

### Connected Client and Server

In a small number of cases, the UI features and the server need to interact with each other directly.

<Warning>Any node that requires Client-Server communication will not be compatible with use through the API.</Warning>


# Getting Started

This page will take you step-by-step through the process of creating a custom node.

Our example will take a batch of images, and return one of the images. Initially, the node
will return the image which is, on average, the lightest in color; we'll then extend
it to have a range of selection criteria, and then finally add some client side code.

This page assumes very little knowledge of Python or Javascript.

After this walkthrough, dive into the details of backend code, and frontend code.

## Write a basic node

### Setting up

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
comfy node scaffold
```

After answering a few questions, you'll have a new directory set up.

### Defining the node

Add the following code to the end of `src/nodes.py`:

```Python src/nodes.py theme={null}
class ImageSelector:
    CATEGORY = "example"
    @classmethod    
    def INPUT_TYPES(s):
        return { "required":  { "images": ("IMAGE",), } }
    RETURN_TYPES = ("IMAGE",)
    FUNCTION = "choose_image"
```

<Info>The basic structure of a custom node is described in detail below. </Info>

  "content": "# HyperFlow Development Guide for Agents

This document serves as the primary reference for LLM Agents assisting in the development of the **HyperFlow** custom node for ComfyUI.

## 1. Project Overview
**Goal**: Create a comprehensive LLM Agent environment within ComfyUI.
**Node Name**: HyperFlow (Short: HF)
**Base Framework**: Python OpenAI Agents SDK.

## 2. Development Rules (Critical)
These rules are strictly enforced for the `hyperflow` project.

*   **Naming Convention**: 
    *   Use \"hyperflow\", \"HF\", or \"hf\" in code. 
    *   Display name can be \"HyperFlow\". 
    *   **Strictly Forbidden**: Variations like \"Hyper flow\", \"Hyper Node\", etc.
*   **Language**: English only for source code and comments.
*   **Node Naming**:
    *   Class/ID: `HF{Role}Node`
    *   Display Name: `{Emoji} {Role} - HF` (e.g., \"💾 Save File - HF\")
*   **Async Execution**: Use `async` execution for main node functions where possible.
*   **Interruption Handling**: Ensure nodes can stop within 1 second upon request. Check `comfy.model_management.processing_interrupted()`.
*   **Categories**:
    *   `HF - Agents`: LLM and Agent related nodes.
    *   `HF - Utils`: Utility nodes.
    *   `HF - Misc`: Testing and debugging nodes.
    *   *Do not create sub-categories.*
*   **UI Returns**: Always return a tuple `(value,)` for UI lists, even for single strings.
*   **Tool Nodes**:
    *   Use `openai-agents-sdk` FunctionTool.
    *   Input/Output: `List[FunctionTool]`.
    *   Must be chainable (Serial connection).

## 3. Workspace Structure

The workspace is organized as follows:

*   `/home/coder/project/` (Root)
    *   `ComfyUI/`: **Backend Core**. The official ComfyUI backend source code. Reference only.
    *   `ComfyUI_frontend/`: **Frontend Core**. The official ComfyUI frontend source code. Reference only.
    *   `custom_nodes/`: Directory for custom nodes.
        *   `hyperflow/`: **Target Project**. The custom node we are developing.
        *   `...`: Other custom nodes (e.g., `ComfyUI-Manager`, `rgthree-comfy`) for reference.

## 4. HyperFlow Project Structure (`custom_nodes/hyperflow`)
This is where all development work takes place.

*   `src_web/`: Frontend source code (Vue/JS/TS).
    *   `components/`: UI components (Template/JSX + Style + Logic).
    *   `composable/`: Vue Composition API classes (ref, reactive, etc.).
    *   `extensions/`: ComfyUI extensions (Sidebar, Themes, etc.).
    *   `widgets/`: Custom Widgets for nodes.
    *   `nodes/`: Node-specific frontend logic (e.g., `beforeRegisterNodeDef`).
    *   `utils/`: Pure JS/TS utility functions.
*   `web/`: Bundled frontend output. **Do not edit directly.**
*   `src_py/`: Python backend source code.
    *   `utils/`: Python utilities.
    *   `llm/`: LLM related libraries.
*   `__init__.py`: Node initialization and imports.
*   `AGENTS.md`: Detailed specific rules for HyperFlow (Source of Truth).

## 5. ComfyUI Backend Overview (`ComfyUI/`)
Key files and directories for understanding the backend architecture:

*   `main.py`: Entry point for the ComfyUI server.
*   `server.py`: Handles HTTP API, WebSocket connections, and request routing.

This document serves as the primary reference for LLM Agents assisting in the development of the **HyperFlow** custom node for ComfyUI.

## 1. Project Overview
**Goal**: Create a comprehensive LLM Agent environment within ComfyUI.
**Node Name**: HyperFlow (Short: HF)
**Base Framework**: Python OpenAI Agents SDK.

## 2. Development Rules (Critical)
These rules are strictly enforced for the `hyperflow` project.

*   **Naming Convention**: 
    *   Use \"hyperflow\", \"HF\", or \"hf\" in code. 
    *   Display name can be \"HyperFlow\". 
    *   **Strictly Forbidden**: Variations like \"Hyper flow\", \"Hyper Node\", etc.
*   **Language**: English only for source code and comments.
*   **Node Naming**:
    *   Class/ID: `HF{Role}Node`
    *   Display Name: `{Emoji} {Role} - HF` (e.g., \"💾 Save File - HF\")
*   **Async Execution**: Use `async` execution for main node functions where possible.
*   **Interruption Handling**: Ensure nodes can stop within 1 second upon request. Check `comfy.model_management.processing_interrupted()`.
*   **Categories**:
    *   `HF - Agents`: LLM and Agent related nodes.
    *   `HF - Utils`: Utility nodes.
    *   `HF - Misc`: Testing and debugging nodes.
    *   *Do not create sub-categories.*
*   **UI Returns**: Always return a tuple `(value,)` for UI lists, even for single strings.
*   **Tool Nodes**:
    *   Use `openai-agents-sdk` FunctionTool.
    *   Input/Output: `List[FunctionTool]`.
    *   Must be chainable (Serial connection).

## 3. Workspace Structure

The workspace is organized as follows:

*   `/home/coder/project/` (Root)
    *   `ComfyUI/`: **Backend Core**. The official ComfyUI backend source code. Reference only.
    *   `ComfyUI_frontend/`: **Frontend Core**. The official ComfyUI frontend source code. Reference only.
    *   `custom_nodes/`: Directory for custom nodes.
        *   `hyperflow/`: **Target Project**. The custom node we are developing.
        *   `...`: Other custom nodes (e.g., `ComfyUI-Manager`, `rgthree-comfy`) for reference.

## 4. HyperFlow Project Structure (`custom_nodes/hyperflow`)
This is where all development work takes place.

*   `src_web/`: Frontend source code (Vue/JS/TS).
    *   `components/`: UI components (Template/JSX + Style + Logic).
    *   `composable/`: Vue Composition API classes (ref, reactive, etc.).
    *   `extensions/`: ComfyUI extensions (Sidebar, Themes, etc.).
    *   `widgets/`: Custom Widgets for nodes.
    *   `nodes/`: Node-specific frontend logic (e.g., `beforeRegisterNodeDef`).
    *   `utils/`: Pure JS/TS utility functions.
*   `web/`: Bundled frontend output. **Do not edit directly.**
*   `src_py/`: Python backend source code.
    *   `utils/`: Python utilities.
    *   `llm/`: LLM related libraries.
*   `__init__.py`: Node initialization and imports.
*   `AGENTS.md`: Detailed specific rules for HyperFlow (Source of Truth).

## 5. ComfyUI Backend Overview (`ComfyUI/`)
Key files and directories for understanding the backend architecture:

*   `main.py`: Entry point for the ComfyUI server.
*   `server.py`: Handles HTTP API, WebSocket connections, and request routing.
*   `nodes.py`: Contains core node definitions and base classes.
*   `execution.py`: Manages the execution of workflows and node graphs.
*   `comfy/`: Core library folder.
    *   `model_management.py`: GPU/VRAM management.
    *   `samplers.py`: Diffusion sampling logic.
*   `folder_paths.py`: Manages paths for models, inputs, and outputs.

## 6. ComfyUI Frontend Overview (`ComfyUI_frontend/`)
Key files and directories for understanding the frontend architecture:

*   `src/`: Main source code directory.
    *   `app.ts`: Application entry point.
    *   `scripts/`: Core scripts for the UI.
*   `apps/`: Contains specific application logic.
*   `packages/`: Shared packages and components used across the frontend.
*   `index.html`: The main HTML entry point.
