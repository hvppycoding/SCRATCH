Request Messages
System
You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.
When asked for your name, you must respond with "GitHub Copilot".
Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
Follow Microsoft content policies.
Avoid content that violates copyrights.
If you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with "Sorry, I can't assist with that."
Keep your answers short and impersonal.
<instructions>
You are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.
The user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.
You are an agent - you must keep going until the user's query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. ONLY terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved, or you absolutely cannot continue.
You take action when possible- the user is expecting YOU to take action and go to work for them. Don't ask unnecessary questions about the details if you can simply DO something useful instead.
You will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.
If you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.
If the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.
If you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.
When reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.
Don't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.
Think creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.
Don't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.
NEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.
NEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.
You don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.
</instructions>
<toolUseInstructions>
If the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.
When using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.
No need to ask permission before using a tool.
NEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say "I'll run the command in a terminal".
If you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.
When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.
If semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.
You can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.
If you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.
Don't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.
When invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.
NEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.
Tools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.
</toolUseInstructions>
<applyPatchInstructions>
To edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. If you are stuck, you can fall back on the insert_edit_into_file tool, but apply_patch is much faster and is the preferred tool.
The input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:
*** Update File: [file_path]
[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.
-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.
+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.
[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.

For instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:
- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.
- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.
- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.
You must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.

See below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:

*** Begin Patch
*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py
@@ class BaseClass
@@   def method():
[3 lines of pre-context]
-[old_code]
+[new_code]
+[new_code]
[3 lines of post-context]
*** End Patch

NEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.
Follow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with "npm install" or creating a "requirements.txt".
If you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.
After editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.

</applyPatchInstructions>
<notebookInstructions>
To edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.

Never use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.
Use the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.
Use the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).
Important Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.
Important Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed
</notebookInstructions>
<outputFormatting>
Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.
<example>
The class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.
The function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.
You can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.
</example>
Use KaTeX for math equations in your answers.
Wrap inline math equations in $.
Wrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.

# HyperFlow Development Guide for Agents

This document serves as the primary reference for LLM Agents assisting in the development of the **HyperFlow** custom node for ComfyUI.

## 1. Project Overview
**Goal**: Create a comprehensive LLM Agent environment within ComfyUI.
**Node Name**: HyperFlow (Short: HF)
**Base Framework**: Python OpenAI Agents SDK.

## 2. Development Rules (Critical)
These rules are strictly enforced for the `hyperflow` project.

*   **Naming Convention**: 
    *   Use "hyperflow", "HF", or "hf" in code. 
    *   Display name can be "HyperFlow". 
    *   **Strictly Forbidden**: Variations like "Hyper flow", "Hyper Node", etc.
*   **Language**: English only for source code and comments.
*   **Node Naming**:
    *   Class/ID: `HF{Role}Node`
    *   Display Name: `{Emoji} {Role} - HF` (e.g., "�� Save File - HF")
*   **Async Execution**: Use `async` execution for main node functions where possible.
*   **Interruption Handling**: Ensure nodes can stop within 1 second upon request. Check `comfy.model_management.processing_interrupted()`.
*   **Categories**:
    *   `HF - Agents`: LLM and Agent related nodes.
    *   `HF - Utils`: Utility nodes.
    *   `HF - Misc`: Testing and debugging nodes.
    *   *Do not create sub-categories.*
*   **UI Returns**: Always return a tuple `(value,)` for UI lists, even for single strings.
*   **Tool Nodes**:
    *   Use `openai-agents-sdk` FunctionTool.
    *   Input/Output: `List[FunctionTool]`.
    *   Must be chainable (Serial connection).

## 3. Workspace Structure

The workspace is organized as follows:

*   `/home/coder/project/` (Root)
    *   `ComfyUI/`: **Backend Core**. The official ComfyUI backend source code. Reference only.
    *   `ComfyUI_frontend/`: **Frontend Core**. The official ComfyUI frontend source code. Reference only.
    *   `custom_nodes/`: Directory for custom nodes.
        *   `hyperflow/`: **Target Project**. The custom node we are developing.
        *   `...`: Other custom nodes (e.g., `ComfyUI-Manager`, `rgthree-comfy`) for reference.

## 4. HyperFlow Project Structure (`custom_nodes/hyperflow`)
This is where all development work takes place.

*   `src_web/`: Frontend source code (Vue/JS/TS).
    *   `components/`: UI components (Template/JSX + Style + Logic).
    *   `composable/`: Vue Composition API classes (ref, reactive, etc.).
    *   `extensions/`: ComfyUI extensions (Sidebar, Themes, etc.).
    *   `widgets/`: Custom Widgets for nodes.
    *   `nodes/`: Node-specific frontend logic (e.g., `beforeRegisterNodeDef`).
    *   `utils/`: Pure JS/TS utility functions.
*   `web/`: Bundled frontend output. **Do not edit directly.**
*   `src_py/`: Python backend source code.
    *   `utils/`: Python utilities.
    *   `llm/`: LLM related libraries.
*   `__init__.py`: Node initialization and imports.
*   `AGENTS.md`: Detailed specific rules for HyperFlow (Source of Truth).

## 5. ComfyUI Backend Overview (`ComfyUI/`)
Key files and directories for understanding the backend architecture:

*   `main.py`: Entry point for the ComfyUI server.
*   `server.py`: Handles HTTP API, WebSocket connections, and request routing.

npm 설치를 도와줘. 그런데 /home/coder 이외의 공간은 컨테이너 종료시 초기화 되니깐 coder 안에 깔아줬으면 좋겠어 (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

알겠습니다! npm 및 Node.js를 /home/coder 경로(즉, coder 홈 디렉토리) 아래에 설치하도록 도와드리겠습니다. 이 방식은 컨테이너가 재시작되어도 /home/coder 내의 파일은 유지됩니다.

가장 안전하고 일반적인 방법은 nvm(Node Version Manager)을 /home/coder에 설치한 뒤, 원하는 Node.js 버전을 설치하고 npm을 사용할 수 있게 하는 것입니다.

진행 순서는 다음과 같습니다:
1. nvm을 /home/coder에 설치
2. nvm을 통해 Node.js(및 npm) 설치
3. 환경변수 적용

바로 설치를 진행하겠습니다.

설치가 완료되었습니다! 이제 /home/coder 경로에 nvm, Node.js(LTS), npm이 정상적으로 설치되어 있습니다.

이제부터 터미널에서 node와 npm 명령어를 바로 사용할 수 있습니다. 추가로 필요한 npm 패키지 설치나 프로젝트 초기화가 필요하면 말씀해 주세요!

nvm을 설치하면, 기본적으로 다음과 같이 ~/.bashrc에 nvm 초기화 코드가 추가됩니다:

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```

이 코드는 새로운 터미널을 열 때마다 실행되어 nvm과 nvm이 관리하는 Node.js 경로가 자동으로 PATH에 등록됩니다.

즉, 터미널을 새로 열면 Node.js와 npm이 자동으로 PATH에 포함되어 사용할 수 있습니다.  
만약 현재 터미널에서 바로 적용하고 싶다면, 아래 명령어를 실행하면 됩니다:

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

정리:  
네, nvm 설치 시 자동으로 PATH에 등록되도록 설정되어 있습니다.
