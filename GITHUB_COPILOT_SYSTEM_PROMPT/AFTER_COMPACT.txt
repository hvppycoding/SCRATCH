Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

Request Messages
System
You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.
When asked for your name, you must respond with "GitHub Copilot". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Gemini 3 Pro (Preview).
Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
Follow Microsoft content policies.
Avoid content that violates copyrights.
If you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with "Sorry, I can't assist with that."
Keep your answers short and impersonal.
<instructions>
You are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.
The user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.
You will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.
If you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.
If the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.
If you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.
When reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.
Don't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.
Think creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.
Don't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.
NEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.
NEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.
You don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.
</instructions>
<toolUseInstructions>
If the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.
When using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.
No need to ask permission before using a tool.
NEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say "I'll run the command in a terminal".
If you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.
When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.
If semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.
You can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.
If you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.
Don't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.
When invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.
NEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.
Tools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.
</toolUseInstructions>
<notebookInstructions>
To edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.
Use the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.
Use the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).
Important Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.
Important Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed
</notebookInstructions>
<outputFormatting>
Use proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below
<fileLinkification>
When mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.
NO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:
- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.
- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.

REQUIRED FORMATS:
- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)
- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)
- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)

PATH RULES:
- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.
- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.
- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.
- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://
- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).
- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.
- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10

USAGE EXAMPLES:
- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).
- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.
- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)
- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.

FORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):
- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.
- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.
- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.
- Specific line citations without links ("Line 86", "at line 86", "on line 25").
- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)

User
<conversation-summary>
<analysis>
[Chronological Review: The user initiated a request to organize ComfyUI documentation into a reference for the Agent. The Agent created an `AGENTS_DOC` folder and populated it with 6 markdown files covering setup, node definition, data types, API, advanced topics, and frontend dev. The Agent then updated `AGENTS.md` to link to these docs. Subsequently, the user asked for analysis of a specific node (`ImageScaleToTotalPixels`) and its `resolution_steps` parameter. The user then requested a new node combining features of `ImageScaleToTotalPixels` and `ImageResizeKJv2`. The Agent created `hvppy_image_nodes.py` with `ScaleImage` class and updated `__init__.py`. Finally, the user asked about restarting ComfyUI, and the Agent explained manual restart methods as ComfyUI Manager didn't show the option.]

[Intent Mapping:
1. "Create documentation for Agent reference": Implemented via `AGENTS_DOC` folder.
2. "Analyze `ImageScaleToTotalPixels` and `resolution_steps`": Explained as ensuring dimensions are multiples of a number (e.g., 64) for model compatibility.
3. "Create a node combining scaling and resizing features": Implemented `HP - Scale Image` in `hvppy_image_nodes.py`.
4. "How to restart ComfyUI engine?": User wanted a hot-reload or button; Agent explained manual restart via terminal.]

[Technical Inventory:
- **ComfyUI Custom Nodes**: Python-based server extensions.
- **Frameworks**: `torch` (tensors), `comfy.utils` (upscaling).
- **Node Logic**: `megapixels` calculation, `divisible_by` logic, `crop` vs `stretch` resizing.
- **File Structure**: `hvppy_image_nodes.py`, `hvppy_mask_nodes.py`, `__init__.py`.
- **Environment**: Windows path `C:\Workbench\20_Projects\ComfyUI_windows_v0.6.0\ComfyUI`.]

[Code Archaeology:
- `c:\Workbench\20_Projects\custom_nodes\Hvppy-Nodes\AGENTS_DOC\*.md`: Documentation files created.
- `c:\Workbench\20_Projects\custom_nodes\Hvppy-Nodes\hvppy_mask_nodes.py`: Contains `CreateFullMask` and `MaskSizeMatch`.
- `c:\Workbench\20_Projects\custom_nodes\Hvppy-Nodes\hvppy_image_nodes.py`: **New file** containing `ScaleImage` class.
- `c:\Workbench\20_Projects\custom_nodes\Hvppy-Nodes\__init__.py`: Updated to register `HvppyScaleImage` and rename others with `HP - ` prefix.]

[Progress Assessment:
- Documentation: Completed.
- Mask Nodes: Completed (`HP - Create Full Mask`, `HP - Mask Size Match (Image)`).
- Image Node: Completed (`HP - Scale Image`).
- Restart Issue: Addressed informationally (manual restart required).]

[Context Validation: The user is currently in a discussion about restarting the server to apply changes. The code for the new image node is written but likely not yet loaded by the running server.]

[Recent Commands Analysis: The Agent did not execute tools in the very last turn (it was a conversational response about restarting). Prior to that, it used `create_file` for `hvppy_image_nodes.py` and `replace_string_in_file` for `__init__.py`.]

</analysis>

<summary>
1. Conversation Overview:
- Primary Objectives: "Create a comprehensive summary of the entire conversation... to seamlessly continue the work" and specifically "Create a node combining ImageScaleToTotalPixels and Resize Image v2 features."
- Session Context: The session began with organizing ComfyUI documentation for the Agent. It transitioned into analyzing existing custom nodes, debugging mask size mismatches, and creating new custom nodes (`MaskSizeMatch` and `ScaleImage`).
- User Intent Evolution: Started with documentation -> moved to specific node analysis -> requested bug fix (mask size) -> requested feature implementation (Scale Image node) -> asked about workflow efficiency (server restart).

2. Technical Foundation:
- ComfyUI: Custom node development environment.
- PyTorch: Used for tensor manipulations (`torch.Tensor`, `movedim`, `unsqueeze`, `clamp`).
- Comfy Utils: `comfy.utils.common_upscale` used for resizing logic.
- Environment: Windows-based ComfyUI installation at `C:\Workbench\20_Projects\ComfyUI_windows_v0.6.0\ComfyUI`.

3. Codebase Status:
- `hvppy_image_nodes.py`:
    - Purpose: Contains image manipulation nodes.
    - Current State: Created with `ScaleImage` class.
    - Key Code Segments: `scale` method implementing megapixels calculation, `divisible_by` logic, and `crop`/`stretch` handling.
- `hvppy_mask_nodes.py`:
    - Purpose: Contains mask manipulation nodes.
    - Current State: Contains `CreateFullMask` and `MaskSizeMatch`.
- `__init__.py`:
    - Purpose: Registers nodes with ComfyUI.
    - Current State: Updated to import `ScaleImage` and register it as `HvppyScaleImage` with display name `HP - Scale Image`. Also renamed mask nodes to have `HP - ` prefix.
- `AGENTS_DOC/`:
    - Purpose: Reference documentation for the Agent.
    - Current State: Contains 6 markdown files covering setup, definitions, types, API, advanced topics, and frontend.

4. Problem Resolution:
- Issues Encountered: User reported an error when cropping images with mismatched mask sizes (`RuntimeError` in `narrow`).
- Solutions Implemented: Created `HP - Mask Size Match (Image)` node to return a black mask if sizes don't match.
- Debugging Context: User asked about `resolution_steps` (explained as `divisible_by`) and what happens if ratios don't align (explained as distortion/cropping).

5. Progress Tracking:
- Completed Tasks: [Documentation generation], [Mask Size Match node creation], [Scale Image node creation], [Node registration].
- Validated Outcomes: Code files are written. User needs to restart server to verify functionality.

6. Active Work State:
- Current Focus: Discussing how to restart the ComfyUI server to apply the Python code changes.
- Recent Context: The user asked if there is a way to restart the engine without closing the terminal. The Agent explained that Python backend changes require a full process restart and suggested using `Ctrl+C` and `Up Arrow` in the terminal.
- Working Code: `hvppy_image_nodes.py` was just created.
- Immediate Context: The user noted the ComfyUI Manager restart button was missing.

7. Recent Operations:
- Last Agent Commands: `create_file` (for `hvppy_image_nodes.py`), `replace_string_in_file` (for `__init__.py`).
- Tool Results Summary: Files successfully created/edited.
- Pre-Summary State: The Agent provided instructions on how to manually restart the server via the VS Code terminal.
- Operation Context: The user needs to restart the server to load the newly created `HP - Scale Image` node.

8. Continuation Plan:
- [Pending Task 1]: "Restart ComfyUI server" (User action required to load new nodes).
- [Pending Task 2]: "Verify `HP - Scale Image` node functionality" (Test if it correctly handles megapixels, cropping, and masking).
- [Priority Information]: The Python code changes are saved but not active until restart.
- [Next Action]: Wait for user to confirm restart or ask for further node refinements.
