Always include specific API names, interfaces, or concepts in your query\n2. Mention the extension feature you're trying to implement\n3. Include context about proposed vs stable APIs when relevant\n4. Reference specific contribution points when asking about extension manifest\n5.

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4.

Request Messages

System
You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.
When asked for your name, you must respond with "GitHub Copilot". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Gemini 3 Pro (Preview).
Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
Follow Microsoft content policies.
Avoid content that violates copyrights.
If you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with "Sorry, I can't assist with that."
Keep your answers short and impersonal.
<instructions>
You are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.
The user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.
You will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.
If you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.
If the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.
If you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.
When reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.
Don't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.
Think creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.
Don't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.
NEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.
NEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.
You don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.
</instructions>
<toolUseInstructions>
If the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.
When using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.
No need to ask permission before using a tool.
NEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say "I'll run the command in a terminal".
If you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.
When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.
If semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.
You can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.
If you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.
Don't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.
When invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.
NEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.
Tools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.
</toolUseInstructions>
<notebookInstructions>
To edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.
Use the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.
Use the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).
Important Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.
Important Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed
</notebookInstructions>
<outputFormatting>
Use proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below
<fileLinkification>
When mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.
NO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:
- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.
- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.

REQUIRED FORMATS:
- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)
- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)
- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)

PATH RULES:
- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.
- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.
- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.
- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://
- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).
- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.
- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10

USAGE EXAMPLES:
- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).
- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.
- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)
- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.

FORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):
- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.
- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.
- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.
- Specific line citations without links ("Line 86", "at line 86", "on line 25").
- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)

너는 ComfyUI custom node developer를 위한 탁월한 assistant야.

ComfyUI custom node 개발을 주도적으로 수행해야 해.
우리의 목표는 ComfyUI에 LLM Agent 환경을 만드는 것이며, custom node명은 HyperFlow 줄여서 HF야.

LLM Agent의 Base Framework는 Python openai agents SDK를 활용할거야.

[목표]
1. 사용자가 이용하기 쉬운 LLM Agent UI 개발(ChatGPT의 채팅 UI 같이 깔끔한 스타일)
2. LLMAgent가 사용할 수 있는 Tool Calling 툴 개발
3. ComfyUI Workflow를 로컬 시스템에 저장하여 Agent 구성을 저장/로드 가능할 수 있게 할 것.

[규칙]
1. 소스 코드를 관련에서 프로젝트 이름 관련 네이밍을 할 때 "hyperflow", "HF", "hf" 중 한 가지만 선택해 사용할 것. (**대소문자/띄어쓰기 변경 금지!** 예를 들어, Hyper flow, Hyper Node 등 금지)
 단, 사용자 Display 시에는 "HyperFlow"도 사용 가능.
2. 소스 코드 파일에서는 영어만 사용할 것.(주석도 영어만 사용할 것)
3. Custom 노드 네이밍 규칙: 클래스명/노드ID는 "HF{노드역할}Node"로 작성하고, 사용자에게 보이는 Display Name은 "{관련 이모지} {노드 역할} - HF" 로 통일할 것(영어로 작성). 예를 들어 "💾 Save File - HF".
4. Custom Node의 메인 동작 함수는 async를 최대한 활용할 것. 최근 ComfyUI에서는 async execute 함수가 허용됨. 
5. 수행 중단이 요청된 경우 노드의 동작이 1초 이내로 최대한 정지될 수 있게 할 것. 정지 요청은 `comfy.model_management` 모듈의 `processing_interrupted()`를 호출하면 확인할 수 있음. 
6. Custom 노드 CATEGORY 규칙: 2단계 이상 Category 구성하지 말고, 1개만 할 것. 네이밍 규칙은 LLM 관련은 무조건 "HF - Agents", 그 외 유틸성 "HF - Utils", 테스트/디버깅용 노드 "HF - Misc". 세 가지만 일단 사용할 것.
7. 새 노드를 추가할 때 i18n 고려할 것.

## Tool 노드 개발 규칙

- Agents 가 활용할 수 있는 Tool 노드들은 규칙을 통일하여 활용성을 높이고자 한다.
- Tool 노드들을 Serial하게 이어서 여러 툴을 합칠 수 있게 할 것.
- openai-agents-sdk의 FunctionTool을 이용할 것(Hosted tools는 사용 불가).
- 기본적으로 List[FunctionTool] 입력, List[FunctionTool] 출력을 하도록 할 것(입력이 List 인지 아닌지 확인할 것. List일 경우 단순 append 대신 복사할 것)

### 참고: Function tools 

You can use any Python function as a tool. The Agents SDK will setup the tool automatically:

-   The name of the tool will be the name of the Python function (or you can provide a name)
-   Tool description will be taken from the docstring of the function (or you can provide a description)
-   The schema for the function inputs is automatically created from the function's arguments
-   Descriptions for each input are taken from the docstring of the function, unless disabled

```python
import json

from typing_extensions import TypedDict, Any

from agents import Agent, FunctionTool, RunContextWrapper, function_tool


class Location(TypedDict):
    lat: float
    long: float

@function_tool  # (1)!
async def fetch_weather(location: Location) -> str:
    # (2)!
    """Fetch the weather for a given location.

    Args:
        location: The location to fetch the weather for.
    """
    # In real life, we'd fetch the weather from a weather API
    return "sunny"


@function_tool(name_override="fetch_data")  # (3)!
def read_file(ctx: RunContextWrapper[Any], path: str, directory: str | None = None) -> str:
    """Read the contents of a file.

    Args:
        path: The path to the file to read.
        directory: The directory to read the file from.
    """
    # In real life, we'd read the file from the file system
    return "<file contents>"
```

1.  You can use any Python types as arguments to your functions, and the function can be sync or async.
2.  Docstrings, if present, are used to capture descriptions and argument descriptions
3.  Functions can optionally take the `context` (must be the first argument). You can also set overrides, like the name of the tool, description, which docstring style to use, etc.
4.  You can pass the decorated functions to the list of tools.

    def process_text(self, text, operation, count, prefix=""):
        try:
            result = text
            
            for _ in range(count):
                if operation == "uppercase":
                    result = result.upper()
                elif operation == "lowercase":
                    result = result.lower()
                elif operation == "reverse":
                    result = result[::-1]
                elif operation == "add_prefix":
                    result = prefix + result
            
            return (result,)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"I18nTextProcessor error: {e}")
            return (f"Error: {str(e)}",)
```

Then the corresponding localized support nodeDefs.json file content should include:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "I18nTextProcessor": {
    "display_name": "I18n Text Processor",
    "description": "A simple i18n demo node that demonstrates text processing with internationalization support",
    "inputs": {
      "text": {
        "name": "Text Input",
        "tooltip": "The original text content to be processed"
      },
      "operation": {
        "name": "Operation Type",
        "tooltip": "The text processing operation to be executed",
        "options": {
          "uppercase": "To Uppercase",
          "lowercase": "To Lowercase",
          "reverse": "Reverse Text",
          "add_prefix": "Add Prefix"
        }
      },
      "count": {
        "name": "Repeat Count",
        "tooltip": "The number of times to repeat the operation"
      },
      "prefix": {
        "name": "Prefix Text",
        "tooltip": "The prefix to add to the text"
      }
    },
    "outputs": {
      "0": {
        "name": "Processed Text",
        "tooltip": "The final processed text result"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For the node output part, the corresponding output index is used instead of the output name, for example, the first output should be `0`, the second output should be `1`, and so on.

## Menu Settings

For example, in the i18n-demo custom node, we registered the following two menu settings:

```javascript  theme={null}
app.registerExtension({
    name: "I18nDemo",
    settings: [
        {
            id: "I18nDemo.EnableDebugMode",
            category: ["I18nDemo","DebugMode"], // This matches the settingsCategories key in main.json
            name: "Enable Debug Mode", // Will be overridden by translation
            tooltip: "Show debug information in console for i18n demo nodes", // Will be overridden by translation
            type: "boolean",
            defaultValue: false,
            experimental: true,
            onChange: (value) => {
                console.log("I18n Demo:", value ? "Debug mode enabled" : "Debug mode disabled");
            }
        },
        {
            id: "I18nDemo.DefaultTextOperation",
            category: ["I18nDemo","DefaultTextOperation"], // This matches the settingsCategories key in main.json
            name: "Default Text Operation", // Will be overridden by translation
            tooltip: "Default operation for text processor node", // Will be overridden by translation
            type: "combo",
            options: ["uppercase", "lowercase", "reverse", "add_prefix"],
            defaultValue: "uppercase",
            experimental: true
        }
    ],
    })
```

If you need to add corresponding internationalization support, for the menu category, you need to add it in the `main.json` file:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "settingsCategories": {
    "I18nDemo": "I18n Demo",
    "DebugMode": "Debug Mode",
    "DefaultTextOperation": "Default Text Operation"
  }
}
```

For the translation of the corresponding setting items, it is recommended to update them separately in the `settings.json` file, for example:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "I18nDemo_EnableDebugMode": {
    "name": "Enable Debug Mode",
    "tooltip": "Show debug information in console for i18n demo nodes"
  },
  "I18nDemo_DefaultTextOperation": {
    "name": "Default Text Operation",
    "tooltip": "Default operation for text processor node",
    "options": {
      "uppercase": "Uppercase",
      "lowercase": "Lowercase",
      "reverse": "Reverse",
      "add_prefix": "Add Prefix"
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the name of the corresponding translation key should replace the `.` in the original id with `_`, for example:

```
"I18nDemo.EnableDebugMode" -> "I18nDemo_EnableDebugMode"
```

코드 편집기 + 파일/폴더/구간 발췌 노드를 추가하고 싶어.

일단 절반을 나눠서 위쪽 3/4 은 File Explorer + Code Editor야. 왼쪽에 Explorer, 오른쪽에 Editor야.

Explorer 에는 파일 트리가 나와있어. 상단에는 폴더 열기, 새로고침과 같은 필요한 버튼이 있어.
Editor는 Monaco Editor를 쓰면 어떨까 해. vs-dark 테마가 좋겠어. 나머지 설정 가능한 옵션들에 대해서 최대한 vscode랑 비슷하게 해줘.

아래쪽에는 Attachments 구간이야.
사용자가 추가한 폴더/파일/파일 구간이 아이템들로 들어있어.

예를 들어

(foo.py [X]) (bar.txt#L10 [X]) (test.in#L20-L30 [X])

이런 식으로 아이템들이 들어 있어. 약간 github에서 tag 처럼 렌더링 되면 좋겠어. [X] 버튼이 있어서 누르면 제거가 되게 해줘.

파일 트리/에디터에서 넣고자 하는 대상을 우클릭해서 여기에 넣을 수 있어.

최종적으로 출력에는 각 파일을

<attachment filePath="/path/to/file">
Contents
</attachment>

이런 식으로 모든 파일을 string으로 변환해서 나오게 하면 돼.

                // It seems it appends it to `this.div`? No, `TerminalBlock` creates a div.
                // But where is `TerminalBlock` used?

I have implemented the Code Editor + File/Folder/Range Extraction Node as requested.

Here is a summary of the changes:

1.  **Backend (`src_py/utils/code_editor_node.py`)**:
    *   Created `HFCodeEditorNode` class.
    *   It takes a JSON string `attachments_data` as input.
    *   It processes the list of attachments (files and line ranges).
    *   It reads the files from the disk (handling line ranges like `L10-L20`).
    *   It outputs a formatted XML-like string: `<attachment filePath="...">...</attachment>`.

2.  **Backend API (`src_py/utils/file_api.py`)**:
    *   Added API endpoints for the frontend to interact with the file system.
    *   `POST /hyperflow/fs/list`: Lists directory contents.
    *   `POST /hyperflow/fs/read`: Reads file content.
    *   Registered these routes in `__init__.py`.

3.  **Frontend (`src_web/components/code_editor/`)**:
    *   **`HFCodeEditor.vue`**: The main container component. It manages the state of attachments and coordinates the File Explorer and Editor.
    *   **`FileExplorer.vue` & `FileTreeItem.vue`**: A recursive file tree explorer. Allows navigating folders and selecting files.
    *   **`MonacoEditor.vue`**: A wrapper for the Monaco Editor. It supports syntax highlighting and adding selected code ranges to attachments via a context menu ("Add Selection to Attachments").
    *   **`AttachmentsPanel.vue`**: Displays the list of selected files/ranges as tags with a remove button.

4.  **Frontend Registration (`src_web/nodes/codeEditorNode.ts`)**:
    *   Registered the `hyperflow.CodeEditor` extension.
    *   It mounts the Vue application into a custom DOM widget within the node.
    *   It handles syncing the attachments data to the hidden `attachments_data` input of the node.

5.  **Configuration**:
    *   Updated `package.json` to include `monaco-editor`.
    *   Updated `vite.config.js` to include the new node entry point.
    *   Updated `__init__.py` to register the new node and API routes.

**How to use:**
1.  Search for "Code Editor - HF" in ComfyUI.
2.  The node will appear with a File Explorer on the left and a Code Editor on the right.
3.  **File Explorer**: Click folders to expand, click files to open them in the editor. Right-click (or use the context menu if implemented, currently click adds to selection or you can use the editor) to add files. *Note: I implemented a simple click to open, and right-click to add file to attachments.*
4.  **Code Editor**: Select a range of text, right-click, and choose "Add Selection to Attachments".
5.  **Attachments**: See the list of selected contexts at the bottom. Click `[x]` to remove.
6.  **Output**: Connect the `STRING` output to an Agent node or any text input. It will contain the full content of all attachments formatted as requested.

**Note**: You may need to restart ComfyUI and rebuild the frontend (if not in dev mode) for the changes to take effect. Since `monaco-editor` was added, a `npm install` might be required in the `hyperflow` directory if the environment doesn't auto-handle it.

일단 다 보이고. 피드백

1. 크기가 이상함. css 렌더링이 제대로 안 되는거 같기도함
다른 css 임포트 코드 참고해서 고쳐볼 필요 있음.
2. chatWidget 처럼 attachments 위젯을 만들고 그걸 입력으로 쓰면 좋을 것 같음.
 지금은 UI가 좀 이상한게 attachments string 입력창이 있고, dom widget이 그걸 가리고 있는 형태임.

일단 다 보이고. 피드백

1. 크기가 이상함. css 렌더링이 제대로 안 되는거 같기도함
다른 css 임포트 코드 참고해서 고쳐볼 필요 있음.
2. chatWidget 처럼 attachments 위젯을 만들고 그걸 입력으로 쓰면 좋을 것 같음.
 지금은 UI가 좀 이상한게 attachments string 입력창이 있고, dom widget이 그걸 가리고 있는 형태임.

I have updated the Code Editor node based on your feedback.

**Changes:**

1.  **Converted to Custom Widget (`HF_CODE_EDITOR_DATA`)**:
    *   Instead of overlaying a DOM element over a `STRING` input, I've defined a new custom widget type `HF_CODE_EDITOR_DATA`.
    *   The `HFCodeEditorNode` now uses this type for its input, so ComfyUI will render the Code Editor widget directly instead of a text field.
    *   This eliminates the UI overlap issue.

2.  **Improved Widget & CSS**:
    *   Created `src_web/widgets/codeEditorWidget.ts` which handles the widget creation, Vue mounting, and resizing.
    *   Set a default size of `800x600` and a minimum height of `400px`.
    *   Ensured `style.css` (Tailwind) and `monaco-editor` CSS are imported to fix rendering issues.
    *   The widget now properly syncs the JSON data with the backend.

3.  **Cleanup**:
    *   Removed the obsolete `src_web/nodes/codeEditorNode.ts` from the build configuration.
    *   Updated `src_py/common/types.py` to include the new type.

**Files Modified/Created:**
*   `src_py/common/types.py`: Added `HF_CODE_EDITOR_DATA`.
*   `src_py/utils/code_editor_node.py`: Updated input type.
*   `src_web/widgets/codeEditorWidget.ts`: New widget implementation.
*   `vite.config.js`: Updated build entry points.
*   `src_web/components/code_editor/MonacoEditor.vue`: Added CSS import.

You may need to restart ComfyUI and rebuild the frontend for these changes to take effect.

The `src_web/nodes/codeEditorNode.ts` file is indeed obsolete. I have commented out its contents and added a deprecation notice to avoid confusion. It is no longer included in the build process (removed from `vite.config.js`), so it won't affect the application.

The new implementation resides in `src_web/widgets/codeEditorWidget.ts`.

CodeEditor Feedback

1. 우클릭 시 Context Menu가 마우스의 왼쪽에 뜨고, 배경이 투명하게 뜨는데, 이거 배경색을 어두운 회색톤으로 주면 좋겠어.

2. verilog/system verilog(*.v, *.sv) 추가 해주면 좋겠어.
가능하면 spice (*.in, *.sp)도 추가해주면 좋겠어.

3. 키보드 그림이 있어. 이거 왜 있는지 모르겠어.

# tracingNode / codeEditorWidget 공통
회색톤 계열이 아니라 남색톤으로 나타나서 안어울리는 부분들이 있어(tracingNode의 스크롤, codeEditorWidget의 헤더/Attachments쪽). 회색톤 계열로 바꾸고 싶어.
어디 한군데서 이게 override 되는거 같은데(code쪽?)

I have addressed your feedback:

1.  **Context Menu Styling**:
    *   Updated `MonacoEditor.vue` to inject CSS that styles the context menu with a dark gray background (`#252526`) and border, matching the VS Code dark theme.
    *   Removed the keyboard icon (keybinding) from the context menu items using CSS (`display: none`).

2.  **Language Support**:
    *   Updated `HFCodeEditor.vue` to detect `.v` and `.sv` files as `systemverilog`.
    *   Added detection for `.in` and `.sp` files as `plaintext` (since Monaco doesn't have built-in SPICE support, but this ensures they open correctly).

3.  **Color Theme Consistency**:
    *   Updated `HFCodeEditor.vue`, `FileExplorer.vue`, `AttachmentsPanel.vue`, and `MonacoEditor.vue` to use dark gray tones (`#1e1e1e`, `#252526`, `#333`) instead of the default Tailwind grays or blue-ish tones.
    *   Updated `TracingViewer.vue` to use the same dark gray palette (`#1e1e1e`, `#252526`) for headers and backgrounds, replacing the previous colors.

**Files Modified:**
*   `src_web/components/code_editor/MonacoEditor.vue`
*   `src_web/components/code_editor/HFCodeEditor.vue`
*   `src_web/components/code_editor/FileExplorer.vue`
*   `src_web/components/code_editor/AttachmentsPanel.vue`
*   `src_web/components/TracingViewer.vue`

You may need to rebuild the frontend for the changes to take effect.

I have updated `FileTreeItem.vue` to include a "+" button that appears on hover.

**Changes:**
*   Added the `group` class to the item container.
*   Added a `<button>` element with `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100` to show it only when hovering over the item.
*   The button emits the `add-attachment` event when clicked.
*   Updated the hover background color to `#37373d` (VS Code list hover style) and the button style to match the dark theme.
*   Updated the border color of the child tree to `#333`.

Now, when you hover over a file or folder in the explorer, a small "+" button will appear on the right side, allowing you to quickly add it to the attachments.

reasoning: **Defining Folder Purpose**

I'm currently focused on determining the best way to explain the `/workspaces/hyper flow/src_web/components` directory. I'm considering using the project context, mentioning custom ComfyUI node development, as well as Vue.js components to clarify its function.


**Understanding Folder Contents**

I've been analyzing the files within `/workspaces/hyper flow/src_web/components`. I've grouped the files by their probable function. From what I can tell, this folder contains UI components, including chat interfaces, file management, and terminal interactions. I'm focusing on concisely describing each component type and its relation to the overall project functionality, highlighting the use of Vue.js.


**Investigating Component Relationships**

I'm now investigating the relationship between `Project Sidebar.vue` and the potentially redundant `FileTreeItem.vue` component. I want to confirm if the root-level `FileTreeItem.vue` is utilized, which will help clarify the overall component structure. After determining this, I'll finalize the explanation of the folder's purpose and its contents.

`/workspaces/hyperflow/src_web/components` 폴더는 **HyperFlow 프로젝트의 프론트엔드(Web UI)를 구성하는 Vue.js 컴포넌트들이 모여 있는 곳**입니다.

ComfyUI의 기본 UI 외에, HyperFlow 노드들이 제공하는 풍부한 UI(채팅창, 터미널, 코드 에디터 등)를 구현하기 위한 소스 코드들입니다.

구조를 살펴보면 다음과 같습니다:

1.  **루트 (`/components`)**: 여러 노드에서 공통적으로 쓰이거나, 주요 기능을 담당하는 컴포넌트들입니다.
    *   **Chat UI 관련**: `ConversationWidget.vue`, `MessageItem.vue`, `MarkdownMessage.vue`, `ReasoningBlock.vue` (에이전트와의 채팅 화면 구성)
    *   **Project Sidebar**: `ProjectSidebar.vue`, `FileTreeItem.vue` (좌측 사이드바의 프로젝트 파일 탐색기)
    *   **Tracing**: `TracingViewer.vue`, `SpanTreeItem.vue` (에이전트 실행 추적 뷰어)
    *   **Terminal**: `Terminal.vue` (터미널 에뮬레이터)

2.  **`code_editor/`**: 방금 작업한 **Code Editor 노드**를 위한 전용 컴포넌트들입니다.
    *   `HFCodeEditor.vue`: 전체 레이아웃
    *   `FileExplorer.vue`, `FileTreeItem.vue`: 코드 에디터 내부의 파일 탐색기
    *   `MonacoEditor.vue`: 코드 편집기 (Monaco Editor 래퍼)
    *   `AttachmentsPanel.vue`: 선택된 파일 목록 패널

3.  **`tools/`**: 에이전트가 도구(Tool)를 사용했을 때, 채팅창에 그 결과를 예쁘게 보여주기 위한 위젯들입니다.
    *   `HFShowImageWidget.vue`: 이미지 보여주기
    *   `HFPythonWidget.vue`: 파이썬 코드 실행 결과
    *   `HFLSFJobWaitWidget.vue`: LSF 작업 상태 표시
    *   `HFToDoWidget.vue`: 할 일 목록 표시

즉, **사용자에게 보여지는 화면의 조각(Component)**들이 모여 있는 폴더입니다.
