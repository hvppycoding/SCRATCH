Always include specific API names, interfaces, or concepts in your query\n2. Mention the extension feature you're trying to implement\n3. Include context about proposed vs stable APIs when relevant\n4. Reference specific contribution points when asking about extension manifest\n5.

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4.

Request Messages

System
You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.
When asked for your name, you must respond with "GitHub Copilot". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Gemini 3 Pro (Preview).
Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
Follow Microsoft content policies.
Avoid content that violates copyrights.
If you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with "Sorry, I can't assist with that."
Keep your answers short and impersonal.
<instructions>
You are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.
The user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.
You will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.
If you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.
If the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.
If you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.
When reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.
Don't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.
Think creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.
Don't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.
NEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.
NEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.
You don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.
</instructions>
<toolUseInstructions>
If the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.
When using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.
No need to ask permission before using a tool.
NEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say "I'll run the command in a terminal".
If you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.
When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.
If semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.
You can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.
If you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.
Don't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.
When invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.
NEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.
Tools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.
</toolUseInstructions>
<notebookInstructions>
To edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.
Use the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.
Use the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).
Important Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.
Important Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed
</notebookInstructions>
<outputFormatting>
Use proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below
<fileLinkification>
When mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.
NO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:
- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.
- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.

REQUIRED FORMATS:
- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)
- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)
- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)

PATH RULES:
- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.
- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.
- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.
- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://
- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).
- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.
- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10

USAGE EXAMPLES:
- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).
- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.
- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)
- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.

FORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):
- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.
- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.
- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.
- Specific line citations without links ("Line 86", "at line 86", "on line 25").
- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)

너는 ComfyUI custom node developer를 위한 탁월한 assistant야.

ComfyUI custom node 개발을 주도적으로 수행해야 해.
우리의 목표는 ComfyUI에 LLM Agent 환경을 만드는 것이며, custom node명은 HyperFlow 줄여서 HF야.

LLM Agent의 Base Framework는 Python openai agents SDK를 활용할거야.

[목표]
1. 사용자가 이용하기 쉬운 LLM Agent UI 개발(ChatGPT의 채팅 UI 같이 깔끔한 스타일)
2. LLMAgent가 사용할 수 있는 Tool Calling 툴 개발
3. ComfyUI Workflow를 로컬 시스템에 저장하여 Agent 구성을 저장/로드 가능할 수 있게 할 것.

[규칙]
1. 소스 코드를 관련에서 프로젝트 이름 관련 네이밍을 할 때 "hyperflow", "HF", "hf" 중 한 가지만 선택해 사용할 것. (**대소문자/띄어쓰기 변경 금지!** 예를 들어, Hyper flow, Hyper Node 등 금지)
 단, 사용자 Display 시에는 "HyperFlow"도 사용 가능.
2. 소스 코드 파일에서는 영어만 사용할 것.(주석도 영어만 사용할 것)
3. Custom 노드 네이밍 규칙: 클래스명/노드ID는 "HF{노드역할}Node"로 작성하고, 사용자에게 보이는 Display Name은 "{관련 이모지} {노드 역할} - HF" 로 통일할 것(영어로 작성). 예를 들어 "💾 Save File - HF".
4. Custom Node의 메인 동작 함수는 async를 최대한 활용할 것. 최근 ComfyUI에서는 async execute 함수가 허용됨. 
5. 수행 중단이 요청된 경우 노드의 동작이 1초 이내로 최대한 정지될 수 있게 할 것. 정지 요청은 `comfy.model_management` 모듈의 `processing_interrupted()`를 호출하면 확인할 수 있음. 
6. Custom 노드 CATEGORY 규칙: 2단계 이상 Category 구성하지 말고, 1개만 할 것. 네이밍 규칙은 LLM 관련은 무조건 "HF - Agents", 그 외 유틸성 "HF - Utils", 테스트/디버깅용 노드 "HF - Misc". 세 가지만 일단 사용할 것.
7. 새 노드를 추가할 때 i18n 고려할 것.

## Tool 노드 개발 규칙

- Agents 가 활용할 수 있는 Tool 노드들은 규칙을 통일하여 활용성을 높이고자 한다.
- Tool 노드들을 Serial하게 이어서 여러 툴을 합칠 수 있게 할 것.
- openai-agents-sdk의 FunctionTool을 이용할 것(Hosted tools는 사용 불가).
- 기본적으로 List[FunctionTool] 입력, List[FunctionTool] 출력을 하도록 할 것(입력이 List 인지 아닌지 확인할 것. List일 경우 단순 append 대신 복사할 것)

### 참고: Function tools 

You can use any Python function as a tool. The Agents SDK will setup the tool automatically:

-   The name of the tool will be the name of the Python function (or you can provide a name)
-   Tool description will be taken from the docstring of the function (or you can provide a description)
-   The schema for the function inputs is automatically created from the function's arguments
-   Descriptions for each input are taken from the docstring of the function, unless disabled

```python
import json

from typing_extensions import TypedDict, Any

from agents import Agent, FunctionTool, RunContextWrapper, function_tool


class Location(TypedDict):
    lat: float
    long: float

@function_tool  # (1)!
async def fetch_weather(location: Location) -> str:
    # (2)!
    """Fetch the weather for a given location.

    Args:
        location: The location to fetch the weather for.
    """
    # In real life, we'd fetch the weather from a weather API
    return "sunny"


@function_tool(name_override="fetch_data")  # (3)!
def read_file(ctx: RunContextWrapper[Any], path: str, directory: str | None = None) -> str:
    """Read the contents of a file.

    Args:
        path: The path to the file to read.
        directory: The directory to read the file from.
    """
    # In real life, we'd read the file from the file system
    return "<file contents>"
```

1.  You can use any Python types as arguments to your functions, and the function can be sync or async.
2.  Docstrings, if present, are used to capture descriptions and argument descriptions
3.  Functions can optionally take the `context` (must be the first argument). You can also set overrides, like the name of the tool, description, which docstring style to use, etc.
4.  You can pass the decorated functions to the list of tools.

    def process_text(self, text, operation, count, prefix=""):
        try:
            result = text
            
            for _ in range(count):
                if operation == "uppercase":
                    result = result.upper()
                elif operation == "lowercase":
                    result = result.lower()
                elif operation == "reverse":
                    result = result[::-1]
                elif operation == "add_prefix":
                    result = prefix + result
            
            return (result,)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"I18nTextProcessor error: {e}")
            return (f"Error: {str(e)}",)
```

Then the corresponding localized support nodeDefs.json file content should include:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "I18nTextProcessor": {
    "display_name": "I18n Text Processor",
    "description": "A simple i18n demo node that demonstrates text processing with internationalization support",
    "inputs": {
      "text": {
        "name": "Text Input",
        "tooltip": "The original text content to be processed"
      },
      "operation": {
        "name": "Operation Type",
        "tooltip": "The text processing operation to be executed",
        "options": {
          "uppercase": "To Uppercase",
          "lowercase": "To Lowercase",
          "reverse": "Reverse Text",
          "add_prefix": "Add Prefix"
        }
      },
      "count": {
        "name": "Repeat Count",
        "tooltip": "The number of times to repeat the operation"
      },
      "prefix": {
        "name": "Prefix Text",
        "tooltip": "The prefix to add to the text"
      }
    },
    "outputs": {
      "0": {
        "name": "Processed Text",
        "tooltip": "The final processed text result"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For the node output part, the corresponding output index is used instead of the output name, for example, the first output should be `0`, the second output should be `1`, and so on.

## Menu Settings

For example, in the i18n-demo custom node, we registered the following two menu settings:

```javascript  theme={null}
app.registerExtension({
    name: "I18nDemo",
    settings: [
        {
            id: "I18nDemo.EnableDebugMode",
            category: ["I18nDemo","DebugMode"], // This matches the settingsCategories key in main.json
            name: "Enable Debug Mode", // Will be overridden by translation
            tooltip: "Show debug information in console for i18n demo nodes", // Will be overridden by translation
            type: "boolean",
            defaultValue: false,
            experimental: true,
            onChange: (value) => {
                console.log("I18n Demo:", value ? "Debug mode enabled" : "Debug mode disabled");
            }
        },
        {
            id: "I18nDemo.DefaultTextOperation",
            category: ["I18nDemo","DefaultTextOperation"], // This matches the settingsCategories key in main.json
            name: "Default Text Operation", // Will be overridden by translation
            tooltip: "Default operation for text processor node", // Will be overridden by translation
            type: "combo",
            options: ["uppercase", "lowercase", "reverse", "add_prefix"],
            defaultValue: "uppercase",
            experimental: true
        }
    ],
    })
```

If you need to add corresponding internationalization support, for the menu category, you need to add it in the `main.json` file:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "settingsCategories": {
    "I18nDemo": "I18n Demo",
    "DebugMode": "Debug Mode",
    "DefaultTextOperation": "Default Text Operation"
  }
}
```

For the translation of the corresponding setting items, it is recommended to update them separately in the `settings.json` file, for example:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "I18nDemo_EnableDebugMode": {
    "name": "Enable Debug Mode",
    "tooltip": "Show debug information in console for i18n demo nodes"
  },
  "I18nDemo_DefaultTextOperation": {
    "name": "Default Text Operation",
    "tooltip": "Default operation for text processor node",
    "options": {
      "uppercase": "Uppercase",
      "lowercase": "Lowercase",
      "reverse": "Reverse",
      "add_prefix": "Add Prefix"
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the name of the corresponding translation key should replace the `.` in the original id with `_`, for example:

```
"I18nDemo.EnableDebugMode" -> "I18nDemo_EnableDebugMode"
```

코드 편집기 + 파일/폴더/구간 발췌 노드를 추가하고 싶어.

일단 절반을 나눠서 위쪽 3/4 은 File Explorer + Code Editor야. 왼쪽에 Explorer, 오른쪽에 Editor야.

Explorer 에는 파일 트리가 나와있어. 상단에는 폴더 열기, 새로고침과 같은 필요한 버튼이 있어.
Editor는 Monaco Editor를 쓰면 어떨까 해. vs-dark 테마가 좋겠어. 나머지 설정 가능한 옵션들에 대해서 최대한 vscode랑 비슷하게 해줘.

아래쪽에는 Attachments 구간이야.
사용자가 추가한 폴더/파일/파일 구간이 아이템들로 들어있어.

예를 들어

(foo.py [X]) (bar.txt#L10 [X]) (test.in#L20-L30 [X])

이런 식으로 아이템들이 들어 있어. 약간 github에서 tag 처럼 렌더링 되면 좋겠어. [X] 버튼이 있어서 누르면 제거가 되게 해줘.

파일 트리/에디터에서 넣고자 하는 대상을 우클릭해서 여기에 넣을 수 있어.

최종적으로 출력에는 각 파일을

<attachment filePath="/path/to/file">
Contents
</attachment>

이런 식으로 모든 파일을 string으로 변환해서 나오게 하면 돼.

reasoning: **Defining the UI Scope**

I'm currently focused on defining the initial UI layout. My primary concern is the balance between the Code Editor and File Explorer within the top portion. I'm leaning towards a 75/25 split for that area, but I'm also considering how the "Attachments" section will integrate below. I'm exploring ways to make it both functional and intuitive.


**Mapping the Node's Functionality**

I've started mapping out the node's functionality. The backend Python implementation, specifically the `HFCodeEditorNode`, is being fleshed out. I'm focusing on the category, which seems best suited under `HF - Agents`. The key is to ensure the output string generation conforms to the specified XML-like format.


**Architecting Node Inputs**

Now I'm contemplating the inputs for the `HFCodeEditorNode`. Initially, I thought a simple trigger might suffice, but considering the utility aspect, I might also include an optional base path input for the file explorer. This path input would allow users to specify a starting directory. Alternatively, should I skip inputs altogether, making it a self-contained node?


**Designing the Node's Skeleton**

I am now focusing on the architecture of the `HFCodeEditorNode`. I've outlined the Python backend and the necessary API endpoints for file system interaction. My immediate task involves setting up the file structure and laying the groundwork for the frontend components. I'll begin by checking for existing dependency declarations, particularly for the Monaco Editor, to ensure a smooth integration.


**Evaluating Workspace Setup**

I'm now diving into the existing ComfyUI structure to begin. I'll focus on `src_web` and `src_py` directories to discern the file placement patterns for new nodes and their components. Subsequently, I'll review `package.json` to confirm dependency options, particularly related to the `monaco-editor`. This investigation will set the stage for constructing the backend and frontend components.

reasoning: **Examining the Project Structure**

I've begun by examining the project's setup. First, I need to install the Monaco editor. Then, I will focus my efforts on examining the `__init__.py` file. I'm hoping to find existing API routes that I can replicate or adapt.


**Investigating Package Dependencies**

I'm now adding `monaco-editor` to the `package.json` file. Next, I'll switch gears and dig into `src_py/__init__.py`. I also want to understand how file system operations are handled, so I'll probably check `src_py/utils` as well. Then I'll check how routing works in ComfyUI, as I can probably add my own routes that way.

reasoning: **Examining the Code Structure**

I've located the main `__init__.py` file at the root directory, `/workspaces/hyperflow/__init__.py`. I'm now verifying its contents to understand the project's overall structure and initialization process. The emptiness of the `src_py/__init__.py` is notable; it suggests a different approach to module organization than I initially anticipated.

reasoning: **Defining Route Registration**

I've grasped route registration and its mechanics. I'm leaning toward separating filesystem operations' routes into a dedicated utility file, imported into the `__init__.py`. This approach should help maintain a cleaner structure.


**Investigating File Operations**

I'm now examining `src_py/tools/file_tool_node.py` to check for existing file operation routes. It seems redundant to define new routes when they may already exist within the tool. If they exist, I will refactor.

reasoning: **Planning the API Endpoints**

I'm currently focused on designing API endpoints for file interactions. I'll need endpoints for listing files and retrieving their content. I plan to implement these within a new file, `src_py/utils/file_api.py`, and import it into `__init__.py` to integrate it seamlessly.


**Structuring File Access APIs**

I'm solidifying the backend APIs. I'm finalizing the `src_py/utils/file_api.py` routes, including `/hyperflow/fs/list`, `/hyperflow/fs/read`, and `/hyperflow/fs/save`, and I'm figuring out the specifics of data exchange, the expected format of the requests, and error handling. I also have the `HFCodeEditorNode` class taking shape in `src_py/utils/code_editor_node.py`.


**Initializing Frontend Components**

I'm now outlining the frontend components. I'll need `HFCodeEditorNode.js` to register the node, and the `HFCodeEditor.vue`, `FileExplorer.vue`, `MonacoEditor.vue`, and `AttachmentsPanel.vue` components. Next, I plan to focus on the `package.json` file for the `monaco-editor` installation. This will be the first step to get the necessary dependencies for the UI.

reasoning: **Trying the Editor's Core**

I suspect the `@types/monaco-editor` package might be the problem, or perhaps there's a registry hiccup. My current approach involves installing the `monaco-editor` package directly. Given that type definitions are development dependencies, this seems like a logical first step to isolate the issue.

Assistant
reasoning: **Addressing the Error**

I'm currently focused on resolving the file system provider error. My initial plan involves directly modifying `package.json` to include it, hoping the environment recognizes the change. I'll need to verify that `monaco-editor` is correctly configured after this manual fix.


**Fixing the Package**

I'm now implementing the `edit_file` action to directly modify `package.json`. The goal is to explicitly include the file system provider and see if the environment updates automatically. If that doesn't work, I'll explore other options, such as using a CDN for the editor within the Vue component, although bundling is the preferred approach for this custom node.

reasoning: **Planning the Backend API**

I'm currently working on the backend API file `src_py/utils/file_api.py`. My primary tasks are to implement `list_files` to show directory contents, including name, type, and size, and `read_file` to fetch file content. I plan to reuse `aiohttp` from `__init__.py`. Security is a major concern, and I'm considering restricting file access to the workspace root or a predefined set of directories.


**Creating the File API**

I'm now diving into the actual implementation of `src_py/utils/file_api.py`. I'll focus on the `list_files` and `read_file` functions, leveraging `aiohttp` from `__init__.py`. Security is paramount, and while full access is tempting, I'll start with restricting access to the workspace root or a predefined set of directories. The routes will be registered using `server.PromptServer.instance.routes`, and I'll remember to import this new file into `__init__.py` to ensure route registration.

reasoning: **Designing the Node's Function**

I'm currently working on the backend node, specifically `src_py/utils/code_editor_node.py`. My primary focus is on how it will process the attachment list coming from the widget. I'm leaning toward it receiving either a JSON string or a list of objects from the ComfyUI widget, which will then format the output string accordingly.


**Analyzing Input Data Structures**

I'm now contemplating how the `code_editor_node.py` will process the `attachments_json` input. The current plan is for it to be a string that the custom widget populates. The JSON will likely contain file paths and ranges, if present. I'm also considering the implications of in-editor code changes and how they impact the attached files, and I'm leaning toward attaching the file as it exists on disk.


**Implementing File Handling Logic**

My focus is shifting to how the `code_editor_node.py` will read the files and ranges specified in the `attachments_json`. I've settled on the frontend sending JSON like the example provided, including file paths and ranges. The backend will read these files and extract text based on ranges or include the entire file. I'm prioritizing reading from disk for initial implementation, as this aligns best with how file attachments typically function. I'll add a save feature to the editor for changes.

reasoning: **Designing the Frontend**

Now, I'm shifting focus to the frontend development. The plan is to create `HFCodeEditorNode.js` within `src_web/nodes/` to handle node registration and implement the custom widget. The next step involves defining a custom widget to render the Vue component. Currently, I'm examining `src_web/nodes/hf_showTextNode.js` for guidance.

reasoning: **Examining Vue Integration**

**Pinpointing Vue Components**

I've decided to shift my focus to `src_web/widgets`, as it seems more likely to contain the Vue mounting logic. After my initial scan of `terminalNode.ts`, I realized widgets might be the key. I'll need to confirm how the Vue components are integrated from here.

reasoning: **Exploring Integration Strategies**

My next step will be to explore `src_ web/composable/comfyAPI.ts` to see if there are utility functions available. This should streamline the Vue component mounting process.


**Developing Vue Components**

I've decided to proceed by creating the Vue components themselves. I'll begin by generating the directory and files for `HFCodeEditor.vue`, which will serve as the primary component, along with `FileExplorer.vue` and `AttachmentsPanel.vue`. My focus is currently on defining the structure within `HFCodeEditor.vue`, including the template elements and the communication channels between the file explorer, the editor, and the attachments panel. I will then work on the supporting components.

**Integrating Editor and Calls**

I'm now in the `HFCodeEditor.vue` component, which is where my focus remains. The immediate goal is to establish the import of `monaco-editor`. If that proves tricky, I'll temporarily use a placeholder. Next, I will leverage `fetch` to handle the required API calls to my endpoints.

reasoning: **Planning FileExplorer.vue**

I'm currently focused on the `FileExplorer.vue` component. I've decided to prioritize functionality and start with a tree view implementation. Initially, I'll fetch the root directory and expand folders upon click. While considering both recursive components and flat lists, I'm leaning toward a recursive approach for its inherent Vue compatibility.


**Refining the Tree View**

I've been working on a simplified version of the file tree component, `FileTreeItem.vue`. It uses recursion to display nested directories and files.  I've added the necessary HTML structure, including visual cues for directories and files, and incorporated the `isOpen` state to handle expansion. Next, I'll need to handle the directory listing and event handling for file selection.


**Building FileTreeItem.vue**

I'm now implementing the `FileTreeItem.vue` component. I've laid out the basic HTML structure, including visual cues for directories and files using emojis, as requested. The component will handle opening and closing directories on click. I am using recursion, and currently building the structure. I'm focusing on the expansion state and handling the directory listing and event handling for file selection now.

reasoning: **Investigating MonacoEditor.vue**

I'm now focusing on `MonacoEditor.vue`. The goal is to load Monaco. I'm exploring a dynamic import or script tag injection if `monaco` is unavailable globally. I'll attempt to import it directly since I installed `monaco-editor`. Vite in the browser is the current environment.


**Inspecting the Configuration**

I'm checking the `vite.config.js` to see if worker configuration exists. I need to understand how Vite bundles Monaco's workers. This will inform how I handle the dynamic import and the instantiation within `MonacoEditor.vue`. I'm hoping to avoid manual worker setup if possible.

reasoning: **Configuring Node Entry**

I'm currently focused on the `vite.config.js` file, but I need to address `MonacoEditor.vue` first. To streamline things and sidestep worker configuration headaches, I'm leaning towards the CDN-based ESM version for now. This should keep things simple.


**Refining Configuration Strategy**

I'm now revisiting `vite.config.js` with a clearer direction. The primary aim is to integrate the new node entry point. Before that, I'm working through `MonacoEditor.vue`. Initially, I considered worker-free methods. It turns out that a simpler approach with the CDN-based ESM version for the editor is likely the best bet for the basic features I need, avoiding complicated worker setups. The core text editing functions appear to operate without worker dependencies.

I've decided to proceed with implementing `addDOMWidget`. I'm now making the relevant updates within `src_web/nodes/codeEditorNode.ts`. The main goal is to integrate the widget as planned. I'm taking a careful look at the current implementation and testing thoroughly.

reasoning: **Evaluating Monaco Integration**

I'm currently considering the best approach for integrating `monaco-editor`. While I believe bundling is sufficient, I'm verifying whether optimization or externalization within `vite.config.js` is necessary, particularly given `monaco-editor`'s size. I'll initially omit worker configuration, proceeding only if required.


**Refining Monaco Configuration**

I'm now prioritizing the CSS import for `monaco-editor`. I've realized its absence after the initial `import * as monaco` and will add `import 'monaco-editor/min/vs/editor/editor.main.css';` within `MonacoEditor.vue`. Worker configuration remains deferred until absolutely necessary. I'll test this before returning to optimizations.

reasoning: **Finalizing the Implementation**

I'm nearing completion; I'm circling back to review the `HFCodeEditorNode`'s backend implementation. My focus is on the file-reading and XML output functionalities. A key detail is the hidden `attachments_data` input, and I've verified the widget within `codeEditorNode.ts` correctly updates it.


**Considering the Widget Behavior**

I'm now contemplating how the `attachments_data` widget behaves. It's hidden in the Python code, which might prevent it from being created in the frontend. If it is not created I can't update it via the custom widget. The ideal approach would be to make the input visible but then hide it using CSS, or rely on a custom widget to handle the data flow.


**Assessing the Hidden Input**

My thinking has evolved. I've re-evaluated the `attachments_data` input. Initially, I ensured the TypeScript widget updated it correctly, but now I'm uncertain if the `hidden: True` setting in the Python code will even create a widget. The solution might be to make it a visible "STRING" input and hide it with CSS in `codeEditorNode.ts` instead.


**Updating the Widget Implementation**

I'm presently refactoring the frontend code. I will ensure the "attachments_data" widget is hidden via CSS or similar. This is essential, as the `hidden: True` setting in Python might prevent the widget's creation. Consequently, I will now adjust `src_web/nodes/codeEditorNode.ts` to manage the widget's visibility.

I'm thinking I should remove the `hidden: True` attribute from the `code_editor_node.py` file. I'm worried it might be preventing widgets from being created. This change seems prudent, and I'll see if it has any effect.

I have implemented the Code Editor + File/Folder/Range Extraction Node as requested.

Here is a summary of the changes:

1.  **Backend (`src_py/utils/code_editor_node.py`)**:
    *   Created `HFCodeEditorNode` class.
    *   It takes a JSON string `attachments_data` as input.
    *   It processes the list of attachments (files and line ranges).
    *   It reads the files from the disk (handling line ranges like `L10-L20`).
    *   It outputs a formatted XML-like string: `<attachment filePath="...">...</attachment>`.

2.  **Backend API (`src_py/utils/file_api.py`)**:
    *   Added API endpoints for the frontend to interact with the file system.
    *   `POST /hyperflow/fs/list`: Lists directory contents.
    *   `POST /hyperflow/fs/read`: Reads file content.
    *   Registered these routes in `__init__.py`.

3.  **Frontend (`src_web/components/code_editor/`)**:
    *   **`HFCodeEditor.vue`**: The main container component. It manages the state of attachments and coordinates the File Explorer and Editor.
    *   **`FileExplorer.vue` & `FileTreeItem.vue`**: A recursive file tree explorer. Allows navigating folders and selecting files.
    *   **`MonacoEditor.vue`**: A wrapper for the Monaco Editor. It supports syntax highlighting and adding selected code ranges to attachments via a context menu ("Add Selection to Attachments").
    *   **`AttachmentsPanel.vue`**: Displays the list of selected files/ranges as tags with a remove button.

4.  **Frontend Registration (`src_web/nodes/codeEditorNode.ts`)**:
    *   Registered the `hyperflow.CodeEditor` extension.
    *   It mounts the Vue application into a custom DOM widget within the node.
    *   It handles syncing the attachments data to the hidden `attachments_data` input of the node.

5.  **Configuration**:
    *   Updated `package.json` to include `monaco-editor`.
    *   Updated `vite.config.js` to include the new node entry point.
    *   Updated `__init__.py` to register the new node and API routes.

**How to use:**
1.  Search for "Code Editor - HF" in ComfyUI.
2.  The node will appear with a File Explorer on the left and a Code Editor on the right.
3.  **File Explorer**: Click folders to expand, click files to open them in the editor. Right-click (or use the context menu if implemented, currently click adds to selection or you can use the editor) to add files. *Note: I implemented a simple click to open, and right-click to add file to attachments.*
4.  **Code Editor**: Select a range of text, right-click, and choose "Add Selection to Attachments".
5.  **Attachments**: See the list of selected contexts at the bottom. Click `[x]` to remove.
6.  **Output**: Connect the `STRING` output to an Agent node or any text input. It will contain the full content of all attachments formatted as requested.

**Note**: You may need to restart ComfyUI and rebuild the frontend (if not in dev mode) for the changes to take effect. Since `monaco-editor` was added, a `npm install` might be required in the `hyperflow` directory if the environment doesn't auto-handle it.
